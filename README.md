# Survival Prediction System for Water-Related Incidents

This project is designed to predict whether a person will be safe from sinking in a water-related incident based on their socio-economic status, age, gender, and other factors. It uses a machine learning model, specifically a Random Forest Classifier, to make these predictions.

*Getting Started*

These instructions will guide you on setting up and running the predictive system in your environment.

*Prerequisites*

You'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

pandas
scikit-learn

*You can install the required libraries using pip:*

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn
Installation

*Clone the repository or download the code to your local machine.*

*Make sure you have the required dataset (CSV file) that contains historical data with columns such as 'SocioEconomicStatus,' 'Age,' 'Gender,' and 'Survival.'*

*Usage*

The system involves two main processes: model training and prediction.

*Dataset*

Replace the 'your_dataset.csv' file in the code with your actual dataset. The dataset should be in CSV format and contain columns for:

'SocioEconomicStatus': Socio-economic status of individuals.
'Age': Age of individuals.
'Gender': Gender of individuals.
'Survival': A binary label indicating survival (1 for safe, 0 for not safe).

*Model Training*

To train the predictive model, follow these steps:

Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script provided.

Load and preprocess your dataset to prepare it for training.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Create a Random Forest Classifier and train it on the training data.

Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy or other relevant metrics.

*Prediction*

To make predictions for a new individual, create a DataFrame with 'SocioEconomicStatus,' 'Age,' and 'Gender' columns and pass it to the model's predict method.

*Contributing*

If you'd like to contribute to this project or improve the code, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
